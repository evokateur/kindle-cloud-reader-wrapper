# Kindle Cloud Reader PWA Wrapper

This is a PWA wrapper for [Kindle Cloud Reader](https://read.amazon.com),
built using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). It provides a native
macOS-style desktop experience for reading Kindle books on [older, non-Metal Macs](https://chatgpt.com/share/6850764a-2418-8012-a04d-2d54a038e04e).
Links that open in a new window will open in your default browser.
